NativeScript applications consist of pages that represent the separate application screens.

Pages are instances of the `Page` class of the [`tns-core-modules/ui/page`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_page_) module. To navigate between pages, you can use the methods of the `Frame` class and the related methods of the [`tns-core-modules/ui/frame`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_frame_) module. The NativeScript pages are having a number of page related events, which are providing different ways to access a Page refernce or its context data.
