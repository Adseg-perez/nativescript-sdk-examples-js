To style and customize the `Button` widget use the conventional CSS properties and Icon Fonts.
The widget also supports the CSS pseudo-selectors `active` (triggered while the button is being pressed) and `disabled` (triggered while the button is disabled).
The example below shows a button with icon (using icon font), several CSS properties and with an `active` state styling.

`Note:` To disable a button use the [`isEnabled`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_button_.button#isenabled) attribute set to `"false"` in your markup instead of the usual `disabled` attribute.
