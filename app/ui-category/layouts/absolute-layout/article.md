The `AbsoluteLayout` is the simplest layout in NativeScript. 
It uses absolute left-top (x/y) coordinates to position its children and the place of each of them depends on its Top, Left, Width and Height properties. 
The `AbsoluteLayout` will not enforce any layout constraints on its elements and will not resize them at runtime when its size changes.
