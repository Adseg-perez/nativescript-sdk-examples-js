NativeScript lets us create dialogs in your app in a manner similar to the web browser. 
We can create alerts, confirmations, prompts, logins and dialogs that require action.
The module `tns-core-modules/ui/dialogs` is loaded globally in every NativeScript application so 
there is no need for explicit require/import of the module.

* [Action](#action)
* [Alert](#alert)
* [Confirm](#confirm)
* [Login](#login)
* [Prompt](#prompt)


> **NOTE**: You can call dialog functions with parameters similar to the web browser API or the `options` object. All dialog functions return a `Promise` object. **In both iOS and Android, dialogs will not block your code execution!**
