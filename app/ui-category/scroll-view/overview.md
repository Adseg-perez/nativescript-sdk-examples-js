The ScrollableView component allows you to display a scrollable area in your application, which has content that is larger than its bounds.
The ScrollView has an `orientation` property, which allows you to set different orientations to the view:

The possible values of `orientation` are:
 - `horizontal`
 - `vertical`
 
It is possible to handle the `scroll` event of the View by binding to the ScrollViewâ€™s `scroll` event.
