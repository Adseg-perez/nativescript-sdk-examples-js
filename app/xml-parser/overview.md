`XML Module` presents a simple way to parse data from an XML content. One scenario, where similar functionality could be used is the cases when a service returns an XML response. The module allows you to go through the XML code and to search for specific attribute and its value or to take the data(e.g. `text` value) locked between the XML elements.
